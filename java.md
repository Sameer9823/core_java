Here’s a **detailed set of notes** covering the concepts you asked for, including explanations, diagrams, and examples.

## 📘 1. **What is Java?**

Java is a **high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language** that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

* Developed by **James Gosling** at Sun Microsystems.
* It's **platform-independent** (Write Once, Run Anywhere – WORA).
* Used for desktop apps, mobile apps (Android), web apps, games, servers, etc.

---

## 🔥 2. **What is JVM (Java Virtual Machine)?**

* JVM is a **runtime environment** that executes Java bytecode.
* It is **platform-dependent** (different for Windows, Mac, Linux).
* Responsibilities:

  * Loads code
  * Verifies code
  * Executes code
  * Provides runtime environment (memory management, security)

---

## ☕ 3. **What is JRE (Java Runtime Environment)?**

* JRE = **JVM + Libraries + Other files** needed to run Java applications.
* It **does not** contain tools for development (like compiler).

📦 **Contains:**

* JVM
* Java class libraries
* Deployment technologies (Java Web Start, Java Plug-in)

---

## 🔁 4. **What is WORA?**

> **WORA** = **Write Once, Run Anywhere**

Java code is compiled into **bytecode** that can run on any platform with a JVM. This gives Java its **platform independence**.

---

## 💻 5. **What is OS (Operating System)?**

* OS is **system software** that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides services for computer programs.
* Examples: Windows, Linux, macOS, Android

---

## 🔣 6. **What is Bytecode?**

* Bytecode is the **intermediate code** generated by the Java compiler (`.class` file).
* It is **not machine code**, but a **portable code** for JVM.

🧠 Example:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

→ Compile: `javac Hello.java` → Generates `Hello.class` (bytecode) → Run using `java Hello`

---

## ⚙️ 7. **How Java Executes Code – Life Cycle**

### ✍️ Steps:

1. **Write Java Code** – `.java` file
2. **Compile** using `javac` – creates `.class` bytecode
3. **Class Loader** – loads `.class` files into JVM
4. **Bytecode Verifier** – checks code for validity
5. **JIT Compiler** – compiles bytecode to native machine code
6. **Execution Engine** – executes native code

### 🧩 Diagram:

```
Source Code (.java)
        ↓ javac
 Bytecode (.class)
        ↓ Class Loader
       [JVM]
        ↓ Bytecode Verifier
        ↓ JIT Compiler
        ↓ Execution Engine
    Machine Code → Output
```

## 🔡 8. **What are Variables in Java?**

A **variable** is a named container for storing data values.

🧠 Syntax:

```java
int age = 25;
String name = "Sameer";
```

Types:

* Local Variable
* Instance Variable
* Static Variable

---

## 🔢 9. **What are Data Types in Java?**

Java is **strongly typed**, so every variable must have a type.

### 🔹 Primitive Data Types:

| Type    | Size | Example           |
| ------- | ---- | ----------------- |
| byte    | 1B   | byte b = 1;       |
| short   | 2B   | short s = 2;      |
| int     | 4B   | int x = 10;       |
| long    | 8B   | long l = 100;     |
| float   | 4B   | float f = 2.3f;   |
| double  | 8B   | double d = 5.7;   |
| char    | 2B   | char c = 'A';     |
| boolean | 1bit | boolean b = true; |

### 🔹 Non-Primitive Types:

* Arrays
* Strings
* Classes
* Interfaces

---

## ✨ 10. **What are Literals?**

Literals are **fixed values** assigned to variables.

```java
int x = 10;         // Integer literal
char y = 'A';       // Character literal
float pi = 3.14f;   // Floating-point literal
boolean flag = true; // Boolean literal
```

---

## 🔄 11. **Type Conversion and Type Casting**

### ✅ **Type Conversion (Implicit/Widening)**

Java automatically converts a smaller data type to a larger one.

```java
int a = 10;
double d = a; // int → double
```

✅ No data loss, safe conversion.

---

### ⚠️ **Type Casting (Explicit/Narrowing)**

You manually convert a larger type into a smaller type.

```java
double d = 9.7;
int a = (int) d; // double → int → a = 9
```

⚠️ Might lose data or precision.

---

### 🔁 Example with Both:

```java
public class Conversion {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        double y = x; // Implicit
        System.out.println(y); // 10.0

        double z = 5.9;
        int w = (int) z; // Explicit
        System.out.println(w); // 5
    }
}
```
