Here’s a **detailed set of notes** covering the concepts you asked for, including explanations, diagrams, and examples.

---

## 📘 1. **What is Java?**

Java is a **high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language** that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

* Developed by **James Gosling** at Sun Microsystems.
* It's **platform-independent** (Write Once, Run Anywhere – WORA).
* Used for desktop apps, mobile apps (Android), web apps, games, servers, etc.

---

## 🔥 2. **What is JVM (Java Virtual Machine)?**

* JVM is a **runtime environment** that executes Java bytecode.
* It is **platform-dependent** (different for Windows, Mac, Linux).
* Responsibilities:

  * Loads code
  * Verifies code
  * Executes code
  * Provides runtime environment (memory management, security)

---

## ☕ 3. **What is JRE (Java Runtime Environment)?**

* JRE = **JVM + Libraries + Other files** needed to run Java applications.
* It **does not** contain tools for development (like compiler).

📦 **Contains:**

* JVM
* Java class libraries
* Deployment technologies (Java Web Start, Java Plug-in)

---

## 🔁 4. **What is WORA?**

> **WORA** = **Write Once, Run Anywhere**

Java code is compiled into **bytecode** that can run on any platform with a JVM. This gives Java its **platform independence**.

---

## 💻 5. **What is OS (Operating System)?**

* OS is **system software** that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides services for computer programs.
* Examples: Windows, Linux, macOS, Android

---

## 🔣 6. **What is Bytecode?**

* Bytecode is the **intermediate code** generated by the Java compiler (`.class` file).
* It is **not machine code**, but a **portable code** for JVM.

🧠 Example:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

→ Compile: `javac Hello.java` → Generates `Hello.class` (bytecode) → Run using `java Hello`

---

## ⚙️ 7. **How Java Executes Code – Life Cycle**

### ✍️ Steps:

1. **Write Java Code** – `.java` file
2. **Compile** using `javac` – creates `.class` bytecode
3. **Class Loader** – loads `.class` files into JVM
4. **Bytecode Verifier** – checks code for validity
5. **JIT Compiler** – compiles bytecode to native machine code
6. **Execution Engine** – executes native code

### 🧩 Diagram:

```
Source Code (.java)
        ↓ javac
 Bytecode (.class)
        ↓ Class Loader
       [JVM]
        ↓ Bytecode Verifier
        ↓ JIT Compiler
        ↓ Execution Engine
    Machine Code → Output
```

## 🔡 8. **What are Variables in Java?**

A **variable** is a named container for storing data values.

🧠 Syntax:

```java
int age = 25;
String name = "Sameer";
```

Types:

* Local Variable
* Instance Variable
* Static Variable

---

## 🔢 9. **What are Data Types in Java?**

Java is **strongly typed**, so every variable must have a type.

### 🔹 Primitive Data Types:

| Type    | Size | Example           |
| ------- | ---- | ----------------- |
| byte    | 1B   | byte b = 1;       |
| short   | 2B   | short s = 2;      |
| int     | 4B   | int x = 10;       |
| long    | 8B   | long l = 100;     |
| float   | 4B   | float f = 2.3f;   |
| double  | 8B   | double d = 5.7;   |
| char    | 2B   | char c = 'A';     |
| boolean | 1bit | boolean b = true; |

### 🔹 Non-Primitive Types:

* Arrays
* Strings
* Classes
* Interfaces

---

## ✨ 10. **What are Literals?**

Literals are **fixed values** assigned to variables.

```java
int x = 10;         // Integer literal
char y = 'A';       // Character literal
float pi = 3.14f;   // Floating-point literal
boolean flag = true; // Boolean literal
```

---

## 🔄 11. **Type Conversion and Type Casting**

### ✅ **Type Conversion (Implicit/Widening)**

Java automatically converts a smaller data type to a larger one.

```java
int a = 10;
double d = a; // int → double
```

✅ No data loss, safe conversion.

---

### ⚠️ **Type Casting (Explicit/Narrowing)**

You manually convert a larger type into a smaller type.

```java
double d = 9.7;
int a = (int) d; // double → int → a = 9
```

⚠️ Might lose data or precision.

---

### 🔁 Example with Both:

```java
public class Conversion {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        double y = x; // Implicit
        System.out.println(y); // 10.0

        double z = 5.9;
        int w = (int) z; // Explicit
        System.out.println(w); // 5
    }
}
```

## 🔁 1. **Conditional Statements in Java**

Conditional statements control the flow of a program **based on conditions** (true/false).

### 🔹 Types:

* **if**
* **if-else**
* **if-else-if**
* **switch**

### 🧠 Examples:

```java
int age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("Eligible to vote");
} else {
    System.out.println("Not eligible");
}
```

---

## ❓ 2. **Ternary Operator in Java**

The **ternary operator** is a **short form of if-else**.

### 🔹 Syntax:

```java
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
```

### 🧠 Example:

```java
int a = 10, b = 20;
int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
System.out.println(max); // 20
```

---

## 🔄 3. **Loops in Java**

Loops allow **repetitive execution** of a block of code.

### 🔹 Types:

* **for loop**
* **while loop**
* **do-while loop**
* **for-each loop** (for arrays/collections)

### 🧠 Examples:

```java
// for loop
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}

// while loop
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}

// do-while loop
int j = 1;
do {
    System.out.println(j);
    j++;
} while (j <= 5);
```

## 💡 4. **OOPs in Java (Object-Oriented Programming)**

Java is an **Object-Oriented Programming Language**.

### 🔹 4 Pillars of OOP:

| Concept           | Description                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encapsulation** | Binding data and code into a single unit (class).                |
| **Inheritance**   | One class inherits properties of another.                        |
| **Polymorphism**  | One task performed in many ways (method overloading/overriding). |
| **Abstraction**   | Hiding internal details and showing only essential info.         |

---

## 🧱 5. **Class and Object**

### 🔹 Class:

* A **blueprint** for objects.
* It defines properties (variables) and behaviors (methods).

```java
class Car {
    String color;
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}
```

### 🔹 Object:

* An **instance** of a class.
* Created using the `new` keyword.

```java
Car c1 = new Car();
c1.color = "Red";
c1.drive();
```

---

## ⚙️ 6. **JDK (Java Development Kit)**

* JDK is the **complete package** for Java development.
* Contains:

  * JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
  * Development tools like `javac`, `java`, debugger, etc.

📦 **JDK = JRE + Compiler + Debugger + Tools**

---

## 🔁 7. **Method Overloading**

* Defining **multiple methods** in the same class with **same name but different parameters** (type or number).

### 🧠 Example:

```java
class Math {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}
```

---

## 🧠 8. **Stack and Heap Memory**

### 🔹 Stack Memory:

* Stores **method calls**, local variables.
* Follows **LIFO (Last In First Out)**.
* Faster and automatically managed.

### 🔹 Heap Memory:

* Stores **objects and instance variables**.
* Slower, but large memory size.
* Requires garbage collection.

### 📊 Difference Table:

| Feature      | Stack                    | Heap                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Stores       | Method calls, local vars | Objects, class fields |
| Access Speed | Fast                     | Slower                |
| Memory Size  | Small                    | Large                 |
| Lifecycle    | Short (method scope)     | Long (global scope)   |
| Managed by   | JVM                      | Garbage Collector     |

| Concept            | Explanation                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conditional        | Executes blocks based on true/false conditions.                               |
| Ternary            | Shortcut for if-else.                                                         |
| Loops              | Repeats code (for, while, do-while).                                          |
| OOPs               | Class-based structure: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction. |
| Class/Object       | Class is a blueprint; object is an instance.                                  |
| JDK                | Complete toolkit for Java (includes compiler + runtime).                      |
| Method Overloading | Same method name, different parameters.                                       |
| Stack vs Heap      | Stack is for execution; heap is for objects.                                  |
